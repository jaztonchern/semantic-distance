# Semantic Distance and Associative Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the research project materials and code for investigating the predictive power of closeness centrality in associative learning, on top of degree centrality. The primary aim is to assess whether closeness centrality serves as a reliable predictor in a paired associates learning task.

## Stimuli

- `final_stim_for_analysis.csv`: This file contains the final stimuli for analysis.
- `items.csv`: Contains items used in the study.
- `lexops_script.R`: Script for selecting stimuli based on lexical properties.
- `potential_stimuli.csv`: Contains data of all potential word items to be used.
- `stimuli.R`: Script related cleaning up stimuli list.
- `swow_network.R`: Script to create the network model for generating stimuli.

## Results

- `cleaned_data_(correct_vs_wrong).csv`: Cleaned data that distinguishes correct and wrong responses.
- `cleaned_data_with_demog.csv`: Cleaned data including demographic information.
- `combined_cleaned_data.csv`: Combined cleaned data with condition.
- `combined_processed_data.csv`: A dataset of all demographic information combined.
